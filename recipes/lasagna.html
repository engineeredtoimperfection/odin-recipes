        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lasagna is made by layering cooked pasta sheets with a meat sauce (often ground beef or pork in tomato sauce), b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and shredded mozzarella. The layers are built up in a baking dish, topped with Parmesan, and baked until golden and bubbling. The result is a rich, savory dish with soft pasta, flavorful sauce, and gooey cheese. Each slice holds together in warm, comforting layers that blend creamy, meaty, and slightly tangy flavors.</p>
